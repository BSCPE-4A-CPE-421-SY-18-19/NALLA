Why did the RPie Model B did not start?

	The reason why the RPie Model B did not start was because the charger 
being used was the charger for RPie Model B+, maybe the charger wasn't compatible for different model. Maybe there were issue about the ampere rate of the charger. There are many reasons why a microcomputer didn't start right away, we must troubleshoot thoroughly before we conclude that it was broken.
